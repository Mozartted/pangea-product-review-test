## Pangea test
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
There are two branches, the `main` branch, and the `firebase-hosted` branch, where I setup deployment of the project for firebase. To test locally, run any of the branches with the following commands.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Demo
At the moment a live version of this project is hosted on [https://pangea-test-ad31a.web.app](https://pangea-test-ad31a.web.app/). It's hosted on Firebase.
